Asciilines

Copyright (c) 2019 Alexandra Llamas

This program creates a 2d array with rendered ascii lines specified by a tvg file. The tvg file will describe the length and width on the first line and the preceding lines contain details on the lines rendered. Once the 2d array is generated, it is displayed to the used.

In order to run this program, it requires the argument of a .tvg file from the tests directory. 
Here is an example call to the code: python3 asciilines.py tests/test1.tvg

At the moment, this program expects that the .tvg file input into the code is valid. Upon invalid input, the program will fail.
